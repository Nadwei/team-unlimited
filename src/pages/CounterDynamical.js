                    For spiritual, moral, social, physical, ethical, or behavioral reasons, you have been entered into an illegal program which plans to destroy your mind, emotions, body, relationships, income, and life.
                    At this point, the important factor is not that you make it out and go back to a simple life where you have time and freedom to do as you want. 
                    You are now in a different place altogether, where you are going to be broken down at the physiological level of cognitive function, which is the unfortunate best case scenario here. Weapons are being tested out and experiments are being performed on various segments of the domestic and international population, at the behest of the US government, as well as other govenements around the world.
                    The things you do from this point until you are literally unable to do anything else, is vital to the future of this planet... and your service and commitment is needed.
                    You will need to do what is possible and within your reach in any way, to maintain your health, relationships, income, and meet your responsibilities, as well as educating yourself, making your own preparations, and compiling research while contributing to the existing body of people who have been willing and able to organize against this.
                    It's like a war, where your service is potentially going to pay off for you, but for all practical purposes, it is to be viewed as a contribution to lessen the burden on those who will newly be brought into this program after you. Efforts made to slow the negative effects on yourself while equipping and empowering yourself as much as you can is to be seen in service of freeing, providing structured information, and doing whatever is possible to lessen the possibliity of a large scale enslavement of humanity through technology.

                    Spiritually, this is about your brothers and sisters in the Human race... people you know, those you don't, those on the right path, even those on the wrong path. It's to preserve a continuity of generational liberty to exist and have the possibliity at all... to have the freedom to stray this way or that, to feel, grow, learn, live, and to be as you are, for the sake of the evolution of the Human race on this planet. 

                    Given that you are still reading, I thank you, and extend the highest regard and appreciation. This is not a task that is to be taken lightly, as your life is going to be taken at some point by these folks. The important part is that you are not alone, and that there is a growing body or organized people, compiling the necessary information, intelligence, and skills necessary to end and expose this program, so that a real discussion can be had about the current state of affairs on this planet, and a new system of organization can come into play. 
                    Monolithic empires are now approaching the finally in a centuries long competition for expanding spheres of influence and control. Those who had the greatest head start, are coming up against newer generations of influence empowered by a rapidly accellerating state of technology, which is changing the rules of the game. Rapidly accellerating spheres of influence once unchallenged in their agendas, are now coming up against critical boundaries of time, and planetary resource available to them. 
                    There is a power grab underway, and power factions are making a last stand sort of movement to establish conditions favorable to their own faction. Often the people doing the work are blind footsoldiers, asserting the agenda of others in the name of whatever is necessary to motivate a human being. Faith, honor, country, ideology, percieved necessity, or sheer naevity. Either way, we are at war, and that is how we should respond. With the cool headed calculating, strategic, poised, intelligence of a leader, of a warrior, of the bearer of flags that have yet to be planted. 

                    The effects of Directed Energy Weapons (DEW) attack the 6 core foundations of a persons ability to think, act,
